# RFM_SQL_Analysis
I explored a sales dataset and generated various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior.
 I analyzed sales revenue and created a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. 
I moved from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions.
 I worked on the following skills: 
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database - SQL Aggregate Functions - SQL Window Functions 
- SQL Sub Query â€“ Concat Function - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) - SQL XML Path Function
